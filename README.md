# Club Team Management System (Java Console Application)

## 📌 Project Description

The **Club Team Management System** is a console-based Java application that helps manage club teams efficiently. It allows users to perform **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on team members and other related entities. The system uses **Java Collections Framework** for in-memory data storage and emphasizes the use of **core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** such as encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism to ensure clean and modular code.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java (JDK 8 or above)**
- **Java Collections Framework**
- **OOPs Concepts**

## 🧱 OOP Concepts Applied

- **Encapsulation** – All member data is encapsulated using private access modifiers and accessed via getters/setters.
- **Abstraction** – Operations are abstracted through interfaces and abstract classes where applicable.
- **Inheritance** – Shared functionality is inherited between different classes.
- **Polymorphism** – Achieved via method overloading and overriding for better flexibility.
